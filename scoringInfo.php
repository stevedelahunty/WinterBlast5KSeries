            <h3>Here's the skinny on how this series will be scored</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><!--i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i--> <span>Signing up for the virtual event gives you an automatic 1,000 points.</span></li>
                <li><span>For the cornhole races, the maximum points for the 5 Miler is 1,000 while the maximum points for the 2.5 miler is only 500.</span></li>
                <li><span>The general rule is that all races will score a maximum of 1,000 points. However, if a race has an option for a shorter distance, then the maximum points for that event will be 500.</span></li>
                <li><span>Series standings will be updated promptly and as accurately as possible, usually within a day or 2 from the completion of an event. Please check the standings and notify Steve Delahunty (steve.delahunty@gmail.com) if you see an error</span></li>
                <li><span><b>FOR WOMEN WHO USE THEIR MAIDEN NAME AND MARRIED NAME TOGETHER...</b>please be consistent as to the spelling of your name when you register. We match people based on their first and last names. If you use a married name in one event, and your maiden name in another, or switch between married, maiden and combined, the scoring software will see you as different people and split your points across those people. </span></li>
            </ul>
